"Start swarm" can refer to several different concepts, depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Swarm Robotics or Technology**: This involves coordinating multiple robots or drones to perform tasks collectively, inspired by the behavior of swarms in nature such as bees, ants, or birds.

2. **Swarm Intelligence**: A concept in artificial intelligence where the collective behavior of decentralized systems (like swarms of insects) is used to solve problems.

3. **Docker Swarm**: A clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. It allows IT admins and developers to establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system.

4. **Beekeeping**: In beekeeping, a "swarm" is a group of bees, usually led by a queen, that leave an established colony to create a new hive.

5. **Marketing or Social Media Strategy**: "Start swarm" can be used metaphorically to describe the launch of a viral campaign where a large number of people are encouraged to engage simultaneously.
